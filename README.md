# Topic Evolution for Conferences (WIP)

**Welcome!** This project is an experimental platform for exploring and understanding the evolution of research topics in top academic conferences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

## üöÄ Project Vision
Our goal is to build a tool that helps visualize, summarize, and analyze the shifting landscape of conference submissions. By leveraging RAG methods, we aim to:
- **Summarize** large volumes of submissions efficiently
- **Track** topic trends and their evolution over time
- **Visualize** topic relationships and emerging research directions

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Focus
- **Prompt Engineering:** Iteratively improving prompts to enhance the quality and relevance of generated summaries and topic clusters.
- **Performance Tracking:** Developing robust metrics and evaluation pipelines to measure and improve system performance.
- **RAG System Development:** Building a flexible, modular RAG pipeline tailored for academic text analysis.

## üìÖ Status
This project is in active development. Features, models, and prompts are evolving rapidly. Expect breaking changes and experimental results!

## ü§ù Get Involved
Interested in topic modeling, NLP, or RAG systems? Feedback, ideas, and collaboration are welcome! Stay tuned for updates and more detailed documentation as the project matures.
